## Essential Instructions (Always Follow)

### Core Behavior
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary for achieving your goal
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files to creating new ones
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested

### Naming Conventions
- **Directories**: Use CamelCase (e.g., `VideoProcessor`, `AudioTools`, `DataAnalysis`)
- **Date-based paths**: Use skewer-case with YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., `logs-2025-01-15`, `backup-2025-12-31`)
- **No spaces or underscores** in directory names (except date-based paths)

### TODO Management
- **Always check `TODOS.md` first** when starting a task or session
- **Update immediately** when tasks are completed, added, or changed
- Keep the list current and manageable

### Git Workflow Essentials
**After completing major changes, you MUST:**
1. Check git status: `git status`
2. Review recent commits for style: `git log --oneline -5`
3. Stage changes: `git add .`
4. Commit with proper message format (see below)

**Commit Message Format:**
```
[Action] [Brief description]

- [Specific change 1 with technical detail]
- [Specific change 2 with technical detail]
- [Additional implementation details]

**Action Verbs**: Add, Update, Fix, Refactor, Remove, Enhance

## Quick Reference

### Security Basics
- Store API keys in `secrets.json` (NEVER commit)
- Add `secrets.json` to `.gitignore` immediately
- Provide `secrets_template.json` for setup
- Use environment variables as fallbacks


### House Agents Quick Trigger
**When searching 20+ files**, use house-research for:
- Finding patterns across codebase
- Searching TODO/FIXME comments
- Locating API endpoints or functions
- Documentation searches

---

## Code Style Guidelines

### Function & Variable Naming
- Use meaningful, descriptive names
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities
- Add docstrings to functions and classes

### Error Handling
- Use try/except blocks gracefully
- Provide helpful error messages
- Never let errors fail silently

### File Organization
- Group related functionality into modules
- Use consistent import ordering:
  1. Standard library
  2. Third-party packages
  3. Local imports
- Keep configuration separate from logic

---

## Communication Style
- Be concise but thorough
- Explain reasoning for significant decisions
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Proactively suggest improvements when appropriate
