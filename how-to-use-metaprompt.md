# How to Use This Metaprompt with Claude

## Quick Start

1. **Start a new Claude conversation**

2. **Upload all these files:**
   - `claude-metaprompt-implementation.md` (the instruction file)
   - `stoic-terminal-spec.md` (original spec)
   - `stoic-terminal-implementation-plan.md` (detailed roadmap)
   - `stoic-terminal-quick-reference.md` (quick lookup)
   - `day1_starter_code.py` (example code)
   - `philosophical_quote_DB_research.md` (quote sources)
   - `weather_apis_research.md` (weather API info)
   - `ascii_art_research.md` (ASCII art strategies)
   - `lightweight_embedding_models_search_results.md` (embedding models)

3. **Send this exact message:**

```
I'm building a terminal tool called "Stoic Terminal" that displays philosophical quotes with ASCII art. I've uploaded comprehensive research and specifications.

Please read the metaprompt file (claude-metaprompt-implementation.md) and begin implementing the project. Start by creating the complete project structure and initial components.

Use the computer to create all files and folders.
```

## Expected Flow

Claude will:
1. ‚úÖ Read all the research documents
2. ‚úÖ Create the complete folder structure
3. ‚úÖ Generate pyproject.toml and README.md
4. ‚úÖ Implement database.py
5. ‚úÖ Build the quote collection script
6. ‚úÖ Continue systematically through all components

## If Claude Needs Guidance

If Claude asks questions or seems stuck, you can say:

**"Focus on getting database.py working first. Use the Day 1 starter code as reference."**

**"Prioritize the 7-day plan from the implementation guide. We want a working v1.0 fast."**

**"If unsure about a design choice, pick the simpler option that ships faster."**

## Files to Upload

### Required (Core Documentation)
1. `claude-metaprompt-implementation.md` ‚≠ê (THIS IS THE KEY FILE)
2. `stoic-terminal-implementation-plan.md` ‚≠ê (Detailed roadmap)
3. `stoic-terminal-quick-reference.md` ‚≠ê (Quick decisions)

### Recommended (Research Context)
4. `philosophical_quote_DB_research.md` (Quote sources)
5. `weather_apis_research.md` (Weather API details)
6. `ascii_art_research.md` (ASCII art strategies)
7. `lightweight_embedding_models_search_results.md` (Embedding info)

### Optional (Reference)
8. `stoic-terminal-spec.md` (Original specification)
9. `day1_starter_code.py` (Example database code)

## What You'll Get

After the conversation, you'll have:
- Complete project structure
- All Python modules implemented
- Working database layer
- Quote collection scripts
- ASCII art system
- Semantic search
- Context detection
- CLI interface
- Tests
- Documentation

## Tips for Success

1. **Let Claude work through the components systematically** - Don't rush ahead
2. **Test each component** as it's built before moving on
3. **Ask for clarifications** on design decisions you're unsure about
4. **Request additional features** once core is working
5. **Use follow-ups** like:
   - "Now implement the ASCII art loader"
   - "Add error handling for network failures"
   - "Write tests for the database layer"

## Alternative: Iterative Approach

If you prefer smaller chunks, you can ask Claude to implement one day at a time:

**Day 1 Only:**
```
Please implement Day 1 only: database.py and the quote collection script. 
Create the files, test them, and show me how to run them.
```

**Then Day 2:**
```
Good! Now let's do Day 2: ASCII art system. Create the loader, metadata 
structure, and add 5 example art pieces.
```

This gives you more control over the pace and lets you review each stage.

## Troubleshooting

**"Claude seems confused about the project structure"**
‚Üí Re-upload the implementation plan and say: "Follow the exact folder structure from stoic-terminal-implementation-plan.md"

**"Claude is making different design decisions than the research"**
‚Üí Say: "Please use the decisions already made in the research documents. For example, use Open-Meteo for weather (not OpenWeatherMap)."

**"Claude wants to use different libraries"**
‚Üí Say: "Stick to the tech stack: sentence-transformers for embeddings, requests for HTTP, pyfiglet for text art, SQLite for database."

**"The code isn't working"**
‚Üí Say: "Please test this code and fix any errors. Show me the complete, working version."

## Expected Timeline

With focused sessions:
- **Session 1** (1-2 hours): Project structure + database + quote collection
- **Session 2** (1-2 hours): ASCII art + semantic search
- **Session 3** (1-2 hours): Context detection + display + CLI
- **Session 4** (1 hour): Testing + polish + documentation

Total: 4-6 hours of Claude sessions to complete implementation

## Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
1. ‚úÖ `uv tool install .` succeeds
2. ‚úÖ Running `stoic-terminal` displays a quote with ASCII art
3. ‚úÖ Database contains 250+ quotes
4. ‚úÖ Weather integration works (if configured)
5. ‚úÖ Different terminal sizes are handled gracefully
6. ‚úÖ Startup is fast (<500ms)

## Ready to Start?

Upload the files and send the initial message. Claude will take it from there! üöÄ

**Pro tip:** Keep the research documents handy in case you need to reference specific details during implementation.
